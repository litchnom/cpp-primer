/* A while loop for counting repeated input values and outputting the count when a new
 * value appears, should be followed by a line to output the count for the last of the
 * counted values. 
 *
 * Assuming the count variable is set up to always default to 1, at the start of a new
 * count, values that only appear once should be counted the same as the rest.*/
