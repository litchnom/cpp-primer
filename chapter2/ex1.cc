/* The differences between int, long, long long, and short are limited to minimum size (16,
 * 32, 64 and 16 bits respectively) as they are all integral character types.
 *
 * A signed and unsigned type differ in the reservation of one bit for storage of a sign,
 * meaning they can represent either positive or negative values.
 *
 * Float and double types differ in the number of words used to represent them (one and two
 * respectively). This means they typically yield seven and sixteen significant digits
 * respectively. */
